# Play Code

## Description

A place to find exercises to practice programming :)

## Contribute / Test

You can clone the project and use with any editor you want, or use Gitpod (a free online VS Code-like IDE) for contributing.

Click in this link to [![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/201flaviosilva-labs/play-code) and see the magic happening.

After cloning/Opened in Gitpod, open a new terminal and change to the exercise you want.

Like this:

- `cd HelloWorld`
- `node run HelloWorld.js`

```sh
Hello World
```

In this case we "changed directory" to `HelloWorld` folder, and run the JavaScript example version.
